TODO

* [X] Pathfinding trolls

  * Ultra basic; need to figure out how to optimize A*/BFS so that running it on each move doesn't take forever.

* [ ] Maze generation
* [ ] Make the trolls crushable
* [ ] UTF-8 boxes for walls (instead of '#'s)
* [ ] Display "Game Over" if player blocks off exit
* [ ] Colorize
* [ ] Try making troll movement time-based
